## 🏁 Challenge Completed: Migration Essentials for Azure and AI Workloads

This section documents my work through the full learning path and hands-on project for the "Migration Essentials for Azure and AI Workloads" challenge.

### 🔧 Completed Labs & Actions

- Migrated a Go-based web application and PostgreSQL database to Azure
- Provisioned a VM and Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flexible Server)
- Verified deployment with real-time web requests and logging
- Applied NSG and ASG rules to limit access and enhance security
- Used **Azure Migrate** for discovery and assessment
- Integrated **Managed Identity** for secure resource access
- Practiced deployment clean-up using Bicep and CLI

### 🔐 Security Best Practices Learned

- Use **Managed Identity** over secrets in code
- Lock down public exposure with **NSGs and ASGs**
- Enable **Monitoring and Defender for Cloud** to assess workloads
- Conduct regular cleanup to minimize security and cost overhead

### 📊 Final Thoughts

This challenge enhanced my understanding of:
- Migrating workloads to Azure safely and effectively
- Securing infrastructure using Azure-native tools
- Integrating AI services like **OpenAI, Document Intelligence**, and **Anomaly Detector**
- Setting up **Synapse Studio**, **Azure Data Lake Gen2**, and secure storage permissions
